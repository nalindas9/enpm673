## How to Run
### Dataset1 
Navigate to folder containing .py files. <br>
Run command `python3 Dataset1.py` <br>
The program will ask to enter the path of the folder of all the images to be read.
The format should be followed : \home\user\..\folder_name
Next program will ask the path to store the rendered video: The format should be '/home/user/../'
Please note, that the code file, the input folder path file and the path of the output must be preferrably in the same directory. 
The output file name would be saved as 'Dataset1.avi'

### Dataset2
Navigate to folder containing .py files.<br>
Run command `python3 Dataset2.py`<br>
The program will ask to enter the path of the folder of all the images to be read.
The format should be followed : \home\user\..\folder_name
Next program will ask the path to store the rendered video: The format should be '/home/user/../'
Please note, that the code file, the input folder path file and the path of the output must be preferrably in the same directory. 
The output file name would be saved as 'challenge_test_lanes.avi'

### Problem1
Navigate to folder containing .py files.<br>
Run command `python3 videoEnhancer.py`<br>
The program will ask to enter the path of the folder of all the images to be read.
The format should be followed : \home\user\..\folder_name
Next program will ask the path to store the rendered video: The format should be '/home/user/../'
Please note, that the code file, the input folder path file and the path of the output must be preferrably in the same directory. 
The output file name would be saved as 'Video Enhancement.avi'
